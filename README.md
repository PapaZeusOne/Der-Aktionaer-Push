## Der Aktionär - Aktuelles
In this project we crawl the webpage [Der Aktionär](https://www.deraktionaer.de/) to send a push notification with Telegram, whenever a new article was posted.

## Motivation
This project is used to gain updated information about the stock market. The webpage does not send automated push notifications whenever a new article was posted and therefore an automated bot should do the job. The journal often informs about trending stocks and allows that way to execute an profitable investment.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)

## Features
This project is used as an extention to the current webpage / app of [Der Aktionär](https://www.deraktionaer.de/).

## Installation
