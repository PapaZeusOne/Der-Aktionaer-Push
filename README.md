## Der Aktionär - Aktuelles
In this project we crawl the webpage https://www.deraktionaer.de/ to send a push notification with Telegram, whenever a new article was posted.
## Motivation
This project is used to gain updated information about the stock market. Due to the webpage does not send automated push notifications whenever a new article was posted, an automated bot should do the job. Sometimes the journal informs about trending stocks and allows that way to execute an profitable investment.
